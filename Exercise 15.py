# Get an int value of base raises to the power of another int value of exponent

'''
Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.

Note: here exp is a non-negative integer, and base is an integer.

def exponent(base, exp):
    return base ** exp

print(exponent(2, 3))
